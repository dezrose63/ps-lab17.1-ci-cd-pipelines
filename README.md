# ps-lab17.1-ci-cd-pipelines
Per Scholas lab 17.1 - review the provided article and video, which discuss the value of CI/CD and compare different implementation tools. Then, anwer the reflection questions in a readme file. 

The “Why” In my opinion, the single most important business reason to adopt a CI/CD pipeline is speed accompanied by confidence. It allows a team to deliver new features and fixes to their users much faster and more frequently. Because the testing is automated, teams can move quickly without the constant paralyzing fear that a new change will break the entire product.

The “How” Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of developers frequently merging their code changes into a shared repository, which immediately triggers automated builds and tests to ensure the new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase. CI ends when it successfully creates a "build artifact"—a packaged version of the application ready to run. Continuous Deployment begins immediately after, taking that artifact and automatically pushing it out to production environments for actual users, without requiring any manual approval step.

Tool Comparison For a small, budget-conscious startup already using GitHub, I would recommend GitHub Actions. Based on the article, the primary reason is its seamless integration; because the code is already there, setting up pipelines using simple YAML files is incredibly fast and requires no external infrastructure. Secondly, the article notes it is budget-friendly, offering free usage for public repositories and a generous free tier for private ones, which is ideal for a startup looking to save costs.

Flexibility vs. Simplicity While GitHub Actions is great for standard setups, Jenkins’ flexibility is necessary for highly complex or "non-standard" environments. A scenario where Jenkins would have a significant advantage is if a company needs to build and deploy legacy software onto very specific, older on-premise hardware or obscure operating systems. The article highlights that Jenkins’ massive plugin ecosystem and ability to run on almost any platform allow it to adapt to these unique, complicated workflows in a way simpler, cloud-native tools cannot.

Personal Connection On a past personal website project, every time I wanted to update the live site, I had to manually open an FTP client, connect to the server, and drag-and-drop the updated files over. It was tedious, and I occasionally forgot to move a specific file, breaking the site. A simple CD pipeline could have automated this, detecting when I pushed code to the "main" branch and immediately transferring only the changed files to the server securely.
